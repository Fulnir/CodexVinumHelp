### Sorting Groups and Topics

Sort topics by including a line like this in the front matter of your topic page: `order: 3`. Number each one as you would like it to appear within its group.

To order groups, open the index.md file and add your group names to the `group_order` hash in this format:
`group_order: {"Group Name": 1, "Another Group": 2}`
